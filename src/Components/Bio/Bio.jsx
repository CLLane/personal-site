        Creative challenges and learning new skills are something I seek in
        every aspect of my life. After a decade of producing a variety of
        cuisines in the hospitality industry, I decided to begin a new
        adventure. Shortly thereafter, I enrolled in Turing School of Software
        and Design to further my knowledge and found that my skills in
        collaboration, creative problem solving, and team management could be
        cultivated in a different way. When I’m not coding, I’m usually hiking,
        running, playing a board game, or painting.
